🧒 What is the vector product and what is it used for?
Imagine two arrows going in different directions.
The vector product is like saying:

“What is the direction that comes out when one arrow pushes the other like a crank?”

🧲 It's like turning a key or a door: a force is released outward, as if something were being lifted.

🔧 So, the vector product gives us a new arrow (a new vector), which:

Is perpendicular to the two original arrows (forms a 90° relationship with both).

Its size (length) tells us how much the two arrows rotate relative to each other.

It's widely used in physics: in forces, torque, rotation, and magnetic fields.
